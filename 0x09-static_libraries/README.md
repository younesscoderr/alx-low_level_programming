0x09. C - Static libraries
this folder is all about creating, 
and use static and shared libraries in c.

 -libmy.a: my own library file that contains all my functions.
 -create_static_lib.sh: this file contains a script that creates a static library called liball.a 
  from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
 -main.h: is my header file that held in the prototype of all my functions.
